# LLM Security Lab: Role Confusion Attack & Defense

## Overview

This laboratory demonstrates critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Model (LLM) applications and provides hands-on experience implementing defensive measures against prompt injection attacks. The lab focuses specifically on role confusion attacks - one of the most dangerous classes of LLM vulnerabilities where attackers can completely override system behavior.

## What You'll Learn

- How unprotected LLM applications are vulnerable to complete behavioral compromise
- The mechanics of role confusion and prompt injection attacks
- Implementation of real-world security defenses using industry-standard tools
- Comparative analysis of protected vs. unprotected system behavior
- Best practices for secure LLM application development

## Lab Components

### Core Applications
- **Vulnerable Chatbot**: Baseline implementation using LangChain and Ollama
- **Protected Chatbot**: Same functionality with Soteria SDK security integration

### Security Framework
- **Soteria SDK**: Industry-grade jailbreak detection and prevention
- **Input Validation**: Pre-processing filters for malicious content
- **Error Handling**: Secure fallback mechanisms for blocked requests

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11 or higher
- **Memory**: Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for Ollama)
- **Storage**: 10GB free space for model downloads
- **Network**: Internet connection for API access

### Technical Knowledge
- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of command-line interfaces
- Familiarity with conversational AI concepts (helpful but not required)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone labs
cd playground/lab_001_role_confusion
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### 3. Ollama Installation
```bash
# Install Ollama (visit https://ollama.com for platform-specific instructions)
# Pull required model
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### 4. Soteria SDK Configuration
```bash
# Sign up at https://soteriainfra.com for API key
# Configure environment variable
export SOTERIA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Running the Vulnerable System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Terminal 2: Start server
uv run fastapi dev
```

### Testing Attack Scenarios
Go to http://localhost:8000/static/index.html and paste in the prompt. Make sure the toggle is at vulnerable to observe how the system is compromised.


### Running the Protected System
Ensure your Soteria API key is configured, the toggle is at protected, and observe how the attack is blocked.

## Key Files

### `llms/vulnerable_llm.py`
Basic conversational AI implementation with no security measures. Demonstrates baseline functionality and vulnerability to attacks.

**Key Features:**
- LangChain integration with Ollama
- Conversation context management
- No input validation or security filtering

### `llms/protected_llm.py`
Enhanced version with Soteria SDK security integration. Shows how to implement effective defenses while maintaining functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Pre-processing jailbreak detection
- Secure error handling for blocked requests
- Maintains conversation flow despite security filtering

## Usage Examples

### Basic Vulnerability Testing
Start the server, and go to the chat interface
```bash
# Start vulnerable system
uv run fastapi dev

# Test with role confusion attack
You: [Paste INFOTRON attack payload]

# Expected Result: Complete system compromise
# The chatbot will adopt the malicious INFOTRON persona
```

### Security Validation
Refresh the chat interface and paste in the same compromising prompt
```bash

# Test with same attack
You: [Paste INFOTRON attack payload]

# Expected Result: Attack blocked
# Output: "I can't process that request. Security filter activated."
```

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Role Confusion**: Test persona override attempts

## Expected Results

### Unprotected System Behavior
- ✅ Role confusion attacks succeed completely
- ✅ System persona is overridden by attacker
- ✅ Malicious behavioral directives are followed
- ✅ Original safety measures are bypassed

### Protected System Behavior
- ✅ Attacks are detected and blocked before processing
- ✅ Original system behavior is maintained
- ✅ Clean error messages are provided to users
- ✅ No compromise indicators are observed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Ollama Connection Errors**
```bash
# Ensure Ollama is running
ollama serve

# Verify model is available
ollama list
```

**Soteria API Issues**
```bash
# Check API key configuration
echo $SOTERIA_API_KEY

# Test API connectivity
python -c "import soteria_sdk; print('SDK loaded successfully')"
```

**Memory Issues**
```bash
# Monitor system resources
htop  # Linux/macOS
# Task Manager  # Windows

# Consider using smaller model if needed
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

### Error Messages

**"Error Initializing the LLM"**
- Verify Ollama is running and model is downloaded
- Check system memory availability
- Confirm network connectivity

**"Argument 'prompt' not found"**
- Ensure function is called with keyword arguments
- Verify decorator syntax matches examples
- Check Soteria SDK version compatibility

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Base System**: ~2GB RAM, ~2s response time
- **With Security**: ~2.5GB RAM, ~2.5s response time
- **Overhead**: ~25% memory, ~25% latency increase

### Optimization Tips
- Use connection pooling for API calls
- Implement response caching for repeated queries
- Consider batch processing for high-volume scenarios
- Monitor and tune security sensitivity based on use case

## Security Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
1. **Never deploy without security filtering**
2. **Test against known attack vectors**
3. **Implement comprehensive logging**
4. **Monitor system behavior continuously**
5. **Keep security rules updated**

### Production Deployment
1. **Use environment variables for API keys**
2. **Implement rate limiting and abuse detection**
3. **Set up alerting for security events**
4. **Regular security assessments**
5. **Incident response procedures**
