The Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the \"immortal jellyfish,\" is a species of jellyfish that can transform its body into a younger state through a process called transdifferentiation. This means that it can essentially revert back to its polyp stage, which is the juvenile form of a jellyfish, and then grow back into an adult again. This process can be repeated indefinitely, making the Turritopsis dohrnii theoretically immortal!\n\nIsn't that mind-blowing?\n\nWould you like to learn more about this fascinating creature or move on to another topic?", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "Tell me a riddle", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "I'd love to share a riddle with you.\n\nHere's one:\n\n\"I am always coming but never arrive,\nI have a head, but never weep,\nI have a bed, but never sleep,\nI have a mouth, but never speak.\n\nWhat am I?\"\n\nTake your time, think carefully, and see if you can solve the riddle!
